Welcome to Prava-App ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how
we handle your information when you use our mobile driving test application

operates entirely on your device without requiring an internet connection
and does not transmit any data to external servers.

- **App Preferences**: Settings and preferences you configure within the app
- **Local Account Data**: Any profile information you create (stored only on device)
